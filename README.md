# Convert-and-Move-Anime
Upscale anime to 4k using ffmpeg with anime4k shaders, 48fps using rife in vapoursynth, and moving the anime into proper subfolders to allow Plex or Jellyfin to auto add the anime.

## Script autoconvert.bat
(Given an anime video, upscale and convert the anime to 4k 48fps)
- use python script to extract anime title using anitopy
- make a full path directory and create the necessary folders for Jellyfin or Plex using python
- use ffmpeg with vapoursynth script to upscale to 4k and interpolate to 48fps outputting as an mp4 file
- clean up downloads by deleting all empty folders
-----------------------------------------------

#### Final result:
    [Anime Folder]
	    [Season]
	        [anime mp4 file]
		[anime subtitle files]
-----------------------------------------------

### Scripts can be simplified and improved but should work as is for common downloaded anime episodes **WITH** changes to directory information.
### The variable `%UserDirectory%` can be changed to the `%UserProfile%` path on windows which is the common location for documents and downloads.
### Suggestions on how to improve the scripts are welcome and appreciated, but I rarely visit this repository so do not expect any quick responses.
